step1: choose the best model . we try every possible model on dataset and see which model perform better  through the mAP . we finally choose rtdetr and yolov8x model for object detection . 
step2: take avarage of 2 model accuracy . 
step3: work on dataset . finding lable problem or box low accuracy , blur img , low mAP img for data augmentation , split night image to improve . 
step4: train again with more than 150 epochs .
